# Efficient Attachment Sync C#
Server-Side C# Equivalent for the Efficient Attachment System made by ragempdev: https://rage.mp/files/file/144-efficient-attachment-sync/

### Server-side
- Copy the AttachmentSync.cs file to your gamemode.
- Make sure you implement the 3 events found in AttachmentSyncExample.cs, it won't work properly without those!

### Client-side
- Download the client-side code from ragempdev's post: https://rage.mp/files/file/144-efficient-attachment-sync/

# Please Note:
This package makes use of the "Base36" NuGet package, you can download it in Visual Studio via `Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage Nuget Packages for this solution -> Browse -> type "Base36" -> First package by "Robert McLaws" & "Steve Barker".`

Other than that it's plug 'n play, enjoy!
